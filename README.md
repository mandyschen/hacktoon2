## Eco Puffs: Mission (not) Impossible

### Introduction
Our team wanted to spread a message about the importance of sustainability to a younger audience, and we saw Power Puff Girls as the perfect opportunity to broadcast to children an important message using their favorite characters.
Gameplay is known to be one of the most effective ways to educate young audiences. That's why, we decided to create a catch game to simulate a world of recycling and composting. The game aims to educate the audience about which item should go in the compost bin and which ones should go in the recycling bin â€” basic knowledge that surprisingly not everyone has! 

### Description
The player controls either Blossom, Bubbles, or Buttercup in collecting items that are meant to either be recycled or put in the compost bin, all while avoiding their arch nemesis Mojo Jojo.
A variety of items will fall from the sky: banana peel, paper, soda can, etc. and your character must catch it and deposit it into the correct bin to earn points.

_A simple, yet intuitive and effective game in educating everyone about sustainability in every day life._

### Game Features
- **Variety of Characters**: Freedom to change to any character (from Blosson, Bubbles or Buttercup) anytime during the game
- **Smooth character movement experience:** left and right arrows to move side ways and UP or SPACE bar to jump
- **Scoreboard:** Keep track of your progress, challenge your friends to beat the score and reign as the champion
- **Fun soundtrack:** Addictive music beats in the background to enhance the gaming experience
